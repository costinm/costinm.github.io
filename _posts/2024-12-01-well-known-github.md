overview: How to use well-known in github

- Adding the .well-known/ directory to a github repo doesn't work - the github.io site is 
published with Jekyll (usually). Adding to _config.yaml 'include' doesn't seem to help.

- The well-known (without dot) does work. Might be an alternative verification if .well-known is blocked - better than just adding to the profile, but risky.
